Dividend and interest income   Dividend from investments are recognised in profit or loss when the right to receive payment is established.   Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably.    Income from financing business   Interest income is recognised in Statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method for all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI and debt instruments designated at FVTPL.   If expectations regarding the cash flows on the financial asset are revised for reasons other than credit risk, the adjustment is recorded as a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset in the balance sheet with an increase or reduction in interest income. The adjustment is subsequently amortised through interest income in the Statement of profit and loss.   When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired, the Group calculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost of the financial asset.
