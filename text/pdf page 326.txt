(Refer note no. 38)  Effect of application of Ind AS 115 on financial statements  The impact of application of Ind AS 115 on the consolidated financial statement mainly arises from the ‘Hospitality’ and ‘Real estate’ segments.

The previous standard permitted the upfront recognition of the non refundable admission fees on sale of membership. In the Real estate segment, the changes are due to recognition of revenue from contract with customers based on satisfaction of performance obligation at a point in time as opposed to previously permitted percentage of completion method. The transitional adjustment of Rs. 1,417.41 crores, net of deferred tax, has been adjusted to Other Equity and Non-Controlling Interests.
