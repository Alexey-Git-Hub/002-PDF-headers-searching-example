201 (“M&M”) and Mahindra Automotive North America (“MANA”) alleging that certain design features of the Mahindra ROXOR infringe the intellectual property rights of Fiat’s Jeep design. Fiat has sought an order for permanently restraining M&M from exporting to US, and MANA from importing into US, any part or component which infringes Fiat’s intellectual property rights. If they succeed in getting permanent injunction, sale of certain parts or components by M&M to MANA will be affected.   M&M believes that the complaint is without merit. It is mounting a defence at the ITC and has commenced a separate action in the United States Federal District Court in Michigan. M&M and MANA are using both venues to enforce the Grill Design Agreement signed by M&M and Fiat in 2009, and to challenge Fiat’s positions on this dispute as being created for this action, and inconsistent with its historical position.  There are legal defences also being asserted related to positions taken on Chrysler’s IP ownership as it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 and was acquired by Fiat. Since the ITC cannot award damages, M&M / MANA brought action in Federal District Court to also assert a claim for compensation, arising out of the harm caused by Fiat using the ITC case to injure the ROXOR business, M&M and MANA by creating negative publicity, damaging our reputation and our stature in the marketplace.  In May 2019, a process of mediation to find an amicable resolution, was commenced between the parties. This process is ongoing.4.
