Impairment loss allowance in the financial services business The key audit matterHow the matter was addressed in our auditWithin the financial services business, the Group has recognized impairment loss allowance of Rs 2,215 crores as at 31 March 2019. The determination of impairment loss allowance is inherently judgmental and relies on managements’ best estimate due to the following:•		Increased	level	of	data	inputs	for	capturing	the historical data to calculate the Probability of Default (‘PDs’) and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) and the completeness and accuracy of that data; •		Use	of	management	overlays	for	considering	the probability weighted scenarios, the forward looking macro-economic factors and the timing of cash flows; and•		Criteria	selected	to	identify	significant	increase in credit risk.Refer note 2(k) – significant accounting policy for impairment of financial assets. We performed the following key audit procedures: •		Assessed	the	design	and	implementation	of	controls	in	respect	of the Group’s loan loss impairment allowance process such as the timely recognition of impairment loss, the completeness and accuracy of reports used in the impairment allowance process and management review processes over the calculation of impairment allowance and the related disclosures on credit risk management; •		Tested	the	relevant	general	IT	and	applications	controls	over	key systems used in the impairment allowance processes. Evaluated whether the methodology applied by the Company is compliant with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards and confirmed that the calculations are performed in accordance with the approved methodology, including checking mathematical accuracy of the workings;•		Tested	the	periods	considered	for	capturing	underlying	data	as	base to PD and LGD calculations, are in line with Company’s recent experience of past observed periods;•		Challenged	completeness	and	validity	of	management	overlays	with assistance of independent financial risk modelling experts by critically evaluating the risks that have been addressed by management through overlays and also considering whether there are other risks not captured which require additional overlays. We also tested management’s workings supporting the overlay quantum; and•		Assessed	whether	the	disclosures	on	key	judgements,	assumptions	and quantitative data with respect to impairment loss allowance in the financial statements are appropriate and sufficient.5.
