Sensitivity Analysis  (a) Foreign Currency Sensitivity    The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in major exchange rates, with all other variables held constant.Rupees croresParticularsCurrencyChange in  rateEffect  on profit before taxYear ended 31st March, 2019 ........................................................KRW/USD+10% 8.68 KRW/JPY+10% (69.54)INR/EUR+10% 3.99 Year	ended	31st March, 2018 ........................................................KRW/USD+10% 13.38 KRW/JPY+10% (49.44)INR/EUR+10% (2.94)    The sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.  (b) Interest Rate sensitivity    The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on exposure to interest rate for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year.    The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected, after the impact of hedge accounting. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:Rupees croresParticularsCurrencyIncrease / decrease in basis pointsEffect on profit before taxEffect on  pre‑tax  equityYear ended 31st March, 2019 .......................................................INR+50 bps (74.85)—EUR+25 bps (1.72) 2.29 Year	ended	31st March, 2018 .......................................................INR+50 bps (56.66)—EUR+25 bps (2.47) 3.56
