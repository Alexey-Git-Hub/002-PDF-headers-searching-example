The India Meteorological Department has forecast ‘a near normal monsoon’ for the coming season. Bank credit off-take has improved and is becoming increasingly broad-based and there has been an increase in financial flows to the commercial sector. Further, the Reserve Bank of India has cut policy rates by 50 basis points in early 2019 and is expected to remain accommodative as inflation is projected to remain below its target level of 4% during the year. Importantly, stability in crude oil and other commodity prices too may bode well for growth.However, there could be headwinds from greater than expected moderation in global growth and global trade as well as unanticipated volatility in global financial markets.FinanceFinancial Year 2018-19 started on a strong note, however cracks began to appear towards the second half of the year as the global expansion – while persisting overall – became more divergent. Business activity softened on account of trade tensions between the United States and China, ambiguity on Brexit and tightening of financial conditions amidst policy uncertainty. Global GDP which grew at a multi-year high of 3.8% in 2017, dropped to 3.6% in 2018 and is expected to taper down to 3.3% in 2019 as per IMF estimates. The growth momentum in US remained strong amid strong employment generation and consumption growth, however the global headwinds have made the Federal Reserve pause on its interest rate hike path. Euro area economy lost more momentum than expected as consumer and business confidence weakened across all major economies causing the European Central Bank to remain accommodative for longer than expected. Crude oil prices saw huge volatility during the financial year reflecting supply influences, including US policy on Iranian oil exports and fears of softening global demand.
