The following year, to present our shareholders with a more holistic view of how we create and sustain long-term value, we included key elements of the Integrated Report (IR) along with the Annual Report. While staying true to the principles of the International Integrated ANNOUNCEMENTReporting Council's framework that was incorporated in the past, this year our Integrated Report structure has evolved to create a more reader-friendly experience.This IR is in consonance with SEBI's circular dated 6th February 2017. An Integrated Report takes corporate reporting beyond just discussing the ﬁnancial resources, as any value creation activity requires other resources like people, natural resources and business relationships. This report will discuss how Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. creates value by leveraging the interlinkages between these interdependent resources. Where necessary, we have explained the concept using charts and infographics.Some IR related data might be management estimates and could be updated in subsequent publications, like the Mahindra Sustainability Report.03314647205062027
