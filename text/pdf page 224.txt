These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.1.

The Company records its long-term investments at cost less any provision for impairment loss. Changes in business environment could have a significant impact on the valuation of these investments. These long-term investments are tested for impairment periodically. If triggers of impairment exist, the recoverable amounts of the investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates are adjusted for any impairment loss. The impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Refer note 2(d)(iv) – significant accounting policy for impairment of investments.We performed the following key audit procedures:•		Assessed	the	design,	implementation	and	operating	effectiveness	of	key controls in respect of the Company’s impairment review process, including the review and approval of forecasts and valuation models;•		Evaluated	reasonableness	of	the	valuation	assumptions,	such	as	discount rates, used by management through reference to external market data;•		Evaluated	past	performances	where	relevant,	and	assessed	historical	accuracy of the forecast produced by management; and•		Enquired	and	challenged	management	on	the	commercial	strategy	associated with the products to ensure that it was consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows.2.
