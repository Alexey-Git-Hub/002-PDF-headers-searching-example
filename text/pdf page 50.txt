We recordEP data separately for AD as well as FES. Following is the EP data trend:We keep increasing the share of RE in M&M (Share of RE has increased from 2% in F18 to 3% in F19), thereby ensuring environment custodianship as well as sustainable growth. Our total RE consumption this year has also increased by 76% as compared to last year. Our total solar and wind power capacities are 8.889 MW and 6.3 MW respectively. The AD Tool and Die Plant in Nashik inaugurated its 838.5 kWp solar powered capabilities in March 2019. This is one more step towards making Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, a Carbon Neutral Company by 2040 with the help of green energy. It is expected to generate ~11 lakh unit per year and will cater to 43% of the annual requirement of the Tool &Die Plant's power requirement, thereby reducing CO emission by 2935 ton per year.The EP for both FES and AD have increased in the reporting year.Energy ProductivityRenewable Energy (RE) Other Key Developmentsof energy saving achieved in F19 49,726GJ0.7510.7940.8251.331.231.28F17F17F18F18F19F19FESAD
