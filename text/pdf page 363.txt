(c)  The Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) by its order dated 7th December, 2009 has rejected the Company’s appeal against the order dated 30th March, 2005 passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise (Adjudication), Navi Mumbai confirming the demand made on the Company for payment of differential excise duty (including penalty) of Rs.304.10 crores in connection with the classification of Company’s Commander range of vehicles, during the years 1991 to 1996. Whilst the Company had classified the Commander range of vehicles as 10-seater attracting a lower rate of excise duty, the Commissioner of Central Excise (Adjudication), Navi Mumbai, has held that these vehicles could not be classified as 10-seater as they did not fulfil the requirement of 10-seater vehicles, as provided under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (MVA) read with Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (MMVR) and as such attracted a higher rate of excise duty. The Company has challenged the CESTAT order in the Supreme Court.    In earlier collateral proceedings on this issue, the CESTAT had, by an order dated 19th July, 2005 settled the controversy in the Company’s favour. The CESTAT had accepted the Company’s submission that MVA and MMVR could not be referred to for determining the classification for the purpose of levy of excise duty and rejected the Department’s appeal against the order of the Collector, Central Excise classifying the Commander range of vehicles as 10-seater. The Department had challenged the CESTAT order in the Supreme Court.    Without prejudice to the grounds raised in this appeal, the Company has paid an amount of Rs. 40.00 crores in January, 2010. The Supreme Court has admitted the Company’s appeal and has stayed the recovery of the balance amount till further orders.    Both these orders of the Tribunals were heard and disposed off by the Honorable Supreme Court, in August 2014. Since contrary views were expressed by the Tribunals in two parallel proceedings, the Honorable Supreme Court directed that a larger bench of the Tribunal be constituted to hear the appeals without expressing any opinion on the issues.    The Larger Bench of the CESTAT heard the matter in February, 2015 and by an order dated 27th February, 2015, remanded the matter to the Commissioner of Central Excise for consideration of the case afresh keeping all issues open. The matter is presently pending before the Honorable Commissioner. The Company strongly believes, based on legal advice it has received, that it has a good case on merits and would eventually succeed in the matter. As regards Commander case the matter is still pending adjudication before the Commissioner. However, pending the final outcome, basis the earlier adjudication order, the Company has reflected the above amount aggregating Rs. 304.10 crores (duty+penalty) and the interest of Rs. 417.13 crores accrued on the same upto 31st March, 2019, under Note (a)(i) above.    In another case relating to Armada range of vehicles manufactured during the years 1992 to 1996, by the Company at its Nashik facility, the Commissioner of Central Excise, Nashik passed an order dated 20th March, 2006 confirming a demand of Rs. 24.75 crores, on the same grounds as adopted for Commander range of vehicles. This matter was heard by the Honorable Tribunal at Mumbai, which allowed the Company’s appeal.  (d)  In respect of (a) & (b) above, it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the closure of these issues and the consequential timings of cash flows, if any. (B) Commitments :  (a)  The estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital account and not provided for as at 31st March, 2019 is Rs. 2,699.71 crores (2018 : Rs.1,032.41 crores) and other commitment as at 31st March, 2019 is Rs. 982.71 crores (2018: Rs. 2,028.73 crores).  (b)  In February 2019, Supreme Court of India in its judgement opined on the applicability of allowances that should be considered to measure obligations under Employees Provident Fund Act, 1952. The Group has been legally advised that there are interpretative challenges on the application of judgement retrospectively and therefore has currently not considered any probable obligations for past periods.41. Research and Development expenditure : In recognised Research and Development units :  Debited to the Statement of Profit and Loss, including certain expenditure based on allocations made by the Group, aggregated to  Rs. 1,440.30 crores (2018 : Rs.1,426.20 crores).
