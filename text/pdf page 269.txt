(b) Interest Rate sensitivity    The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on exposure to interest rate for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year.    The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected, after the impact of hedge accounting. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:Rupees croresParticularsCurrencyIncrease/decrease in basis pointsEffect  on profit before taxEffect on  pre-tax  equityYear ended 31st March, 2019 .......................................................EUR+25— 2.29 Year ended 31st March, 2018 .......................................................EUR+25— 3.56  5.
