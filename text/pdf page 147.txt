This is signicantly lower than the ve-year CAGR of 6.2% for the PV segment. The Utility Vehicle (UV) sub-segment had witnessed good growth of 12.4% CAGR over last 5 years. However, for FY19, this has dropped to just 2.1%.During the year FY19, the industry implemented new safety norms for cars and utility vehicles.

The LCV 2-3.5T which is the Pik-Up segment, has shown a healthy growth of 13.3% CAGR over last 10 years. This sustained growth is a result of increasing affordability in the agri, rural economy and availability of affordable nance.Automotive exports from India was a good growth story, with many OEMs leveraging competitiveness of Indian manufacturing for exports from India. However, in the last ve years, exports from India, especially for PVs, CVs and 2W has slowed down signicantly. PV exports grew at just 2.6% CAGR in the period F14 - F19 as against 12.1% CAGR in the period F09 - F14. Similarly, growth for CV exports has dropped to 5.3% CAGR in the period F14 - F19 as against 12.6% CAGR in the period F09 - F14. 2018-19 needs to be reviewed in two parts, the rst ve months (April - August) where the industry had strong growth, and the next seven months (September - March) where there was a sudden drop in demand. The table below summarises the growth patterns in the two periods for FY19.
