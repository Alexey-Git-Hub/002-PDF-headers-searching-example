22We proactively identify risks before they become challenges and work out ways either to mitigate them or turn them into opportunities. Periodically, we conduct an exercise for identifying risks and opportunities. The Chief Risk Ofﬁcer and the Chief Sustainability Ofﬁcer are engaged through a structured process to deliberate on possible risks and opportunities from Technology-Economic-Media-Political-Legal-Environmental-Social (TEMPLES) framework.
